A card game?

## Summary

Javelin is a card game played with a standard deck of 52 cards between two
players. Players start with 16 cards each, 8 face-up and 8 face-down. The
objective is to reveal all of your opponent's face-down cards, or cause
them to run out of face-up cards.

## Rules of Play

* Players are dealt 16 cards, the first 8 of which are placed face-down, the
  remainder face-up, in front of the player in two rows, with the face-down
  cards closer to the player.
* Taking turns and starting with the player who dealt, each player performs
  one of the following actions during their turn:
    * Guess an opponent's face-down card
    * Eliminate an opponent's face-up card
    * Exchange a face-up card of their own
    * Forfeit (not recommended)
* At the end of a turn, if either of the below conditions are true for a
  player, that player loses the round and players proceed to scoring:
    * All of their previously face-down cards are now face-up
    * None of their cards are face-up
